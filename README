Telnet is the main focus for the client software, and its unencrypted and old as hell. 
For now you can connect using the included script "client.bat"/"client.sh", but in 
the future I will probably add basic public key encryption with some client.py script.
Anyway,

--how to host a server--
  1. run the program.
  2. input your username. (yes the server has a username. how nifty.)
  3. it will listen on port 8088, but this can be changed in the server.py file
  4. port forward a TCP port on your router
    a. its a bit insecure in the sense that someone could see the trafic going into this port (because telnet is unencrypted)
    b. later i will add SSL (secure sockets layer)
  5. the client can connect and they will now be able to chat with you.
  6. to be goated, get a domain attatched to the ip adress.

--how to use telnet--
  1. $ telnet xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 8088
